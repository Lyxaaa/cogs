### Obtaining the Android SDK

_**a.**_ With Android Studio:  
_https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/update#sdk-manager_

_**b.**_ If not running Android Studio, you will need to download the Android SDK manually.  
_https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools_

1. Move the download to a preferred <location>  
(E.g., a directory for development tools.)  
1. Create a directory structure like so: <location>\android-sdk\cmdline-tools\  
1. Enter the directory.  
1. Unpack the download, renaming the folder from cmdline-tools to latest  
The directory structure should now look like: <location>\android-sdk\cmdline-tools\latest  
1. Add the environment variables:
   ```bash
   ANDROID_SDK_ROOT  <location>\android-sdk  
   ANDROID_HOME      <location>\android-sdk
   ```
1. In a terminal, **cd** into `latest/bin` folder. Run the following command.  
 
   ```bash
   sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-30" "build-tools;30.0.3"
   ```
1. Return to the original instructions, continuing at flutter doctor
