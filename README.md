## Deployment Instructions
### Web Access
You can access the latest build at both [Host A]() and [Host B]()

### Installing Flutter
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
From this link, make sure to download flutter v2.5.x

Follow the instructions until... 
flutter doctor  
At this point, consider which IDE youâ€™ll work in: Android Studio, or Visual Studio Code.

Android Studio is more established.
Visual Studio Code is newly supported.

### Obtaining the Android SDK
With Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/update#sdk-manager  

If not running Android Studio, you will need to download the Android SDK manually. https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools  

Move the download to a preferred <location>  
(E.g., a directory for development tools.)  
Create a directory structure like so: <location>\android-sdk\cmdline-tools\  
Enter the directory.  
Unpack the download, renaming the folder from cmdline-tools to latest  
The directory structure should now look like: <location>\android-sdk\cmdline-tools\latest  
Add the environment variables:  
ANDROID_SDK_ROOT  <location>\android-sdk  
ANDROID_HOME <location>\android-sdk  
In a terminal, cd into latest/bin folder.  
Run the following command.  
sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-30" "build-tools;30.0.3"  
 
Return to the original instructions, continuing at flutter doctor
